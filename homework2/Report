1. Problem
Want to calculate the sum of a randomly generated array with 512M elements on GPU. Make sure of its correctness. Test and optimize its performance.

Hardware:
Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 w/ 2048 CUDA cores and 4 GB of Memory.

2. Structures the problem
The problem is really down to two parts:
1) Develope an efficient algorithm/data structure to run this problem on GPU.

2) Tweak the configuration of the code to achieve best optimization.

//Handy material: sample code of reduction from Nvidia

3. Algorithm
Basic idea: Divide and conquer.
Try to map all elements to every possible core in order to utilize all cores. By this, each thread will handle a few elements from the array, add them and store the result in shared memory. Then do a second tier reduction, thrid tier reduction etc. Until the final answer is found. (i.e. in the end there should be only one number left)
Total runtime O(n).
4. Optimization
Number of threads, number of blocks, number of tiers of reduction. Direction of Dim3 (vertial or horizontal)
5. Result
