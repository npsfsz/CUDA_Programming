1. Problem
Want to calculate the sum of a randomly generated array with 512M elements on GPU. Make sure of its correctness. Test and optimize its performance.

Hardware:
Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 w/ 2048 CUDA cores and 4 GB of Memory.

2. Structures the problem
The problem is really down to two parts:
1) Develope an efficient algorithm/data structure to run this problem on GPU.

2) Tweak the configuration of the code to achieve best optimization.

//Handy material: sample code of reduction from Nvidia
